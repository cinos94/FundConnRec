Things that should be improved :<br>
1.Logging information - probably by Filters or some other frameworks like Autofac and interceptors<br>
2.Data Validation - didn't work on that at all<br>
3.Unit tests - Created one basic unit test just to show frameworks I normally use and how i write them<br>
4.ConfigurationRepository - which was not propetly injected into PortfolioRepository as i ran into an issue with properties not correctly loaded from appsettings.json (which forced me to go plan with B with IConfiguration) <br>
5.SecurityRepository and PortfolioRepository - there are few methods not implemented as they were not required to complete the task but would definitely make it better with more time<br>
6.Also I didn't make methods of getting latest portfolio by ISIN and creating analytical operations - I ran out of time but I would make them in the same way so I hope overall score won't be affected by this :)<br>
